## Exercise 5 (Optional)

**Problem:**
Make a game where the program picks a random number between 1 and 20.
The user keeps guessing until the correct number is guessed.


**Example**

    Program: I have chosen a number between 1 and 20. Guess it!
    User: 10
    Program: Too high!
    User: 5
    Program: Too low!
    User: 7
    Program: Correct! You guessed it in 3 tries.

## Exercise 6 (Optional)

**Problem:**
Bulls and Cows game:

- The computer generates a random 3-digit number (with non-repeating digits).
- The user guesses the number.
- After each guess, the program tells:
    - Bulls: Digits that are correct and in the right place.
    - Cows: Digits that are correct but in the wrong place.
- The game continues until the user guesses correctly (3 bulls).

**Example**

    Computer has chosen a 3-digit number. Try to guess it!
    
    Enter guess: 123
    Result: 1 bull(s), 1 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 456
    Result: 0 bull(s), 0 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 321
    Result: 0 bull(s), 3 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 135
    Result: 1 bull(s), 2 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 159
    Result: 3 bull(s), 0 cow(s)
    
    Congratulations! You guessed the number: 159
